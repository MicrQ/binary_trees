<h1> Binary Trees</h1>

This project is part of <b>ALX Software Engineering Program.</b> It covers:- 
    * Tree Implementation
    * Tree traversing algorithms
    * Tree Node Creation


## Usage

### To check compile, run and check each program, You need to complile the program with nessecary file as follow.

This is the way to compile and run :
    * for 0-binary_tree_node.c use `gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic binary_tree_print.c 0-main.c 0-binary_tree_node.c -o 0-node` and run the executable `./0-node`.
    
    *

This Project helped me master on tree data structures. Throughout the entire project, I've been enjoying the process.

Thanks to ALX!
